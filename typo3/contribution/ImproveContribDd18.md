# TYPO3 Contribution

## Session "Improve Core Contribution Workflow" Developer Days TYPO3 2018

During the TYPO3 Developer Days 2018 I did a brainstorming session on the
topic "["Improve Core Contribution Workflow"](https://t3dd18.typo3.org/schedule/#c813) (Sybille Peters)"

### Description of session

Some people have been contributing to the core for years and new people join on a regular basis. 
It's a huge task to manage and it is running very smoothly. 

What can we do to make it even better?

Do you have ideas for optimizing the workflow or the documentation?
* Do people keep asking the same questions and run into the same problems? Are there common pitfalls or sources of frustration?
* What tools do you use when you develop? Can you share some of your knowledge?
* How can we motivate people to contribute?
* What bugs you the most and what is worth the time to do something about it?

This is a brainstorming session.

Core contribution includes 
* opening issues
* improving / managing issues
* submitting patches
* commenting on, reviewing or testing patches
* raising common questions
* helping others
* providing tools
* contributing to the testsuite 
* documenting the workflow.
